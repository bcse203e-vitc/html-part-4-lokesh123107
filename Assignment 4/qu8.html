      <h2>The Rise of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <div class="columns">
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed from a niche area of computer science into a driving force behind many of todayâ€™s innovations. From recommendation engines on streaming platforms to fraud detection in banking, AI impacts millions of people every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Machine Learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn patterns from data without explicit programming. Algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks power applications across healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. These tools are not only efficient but also adaptive as more data is introduced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep Learning, which leverages multi-layered neural networks, has unlocked breakthroughs in natural language processing and computer vision. Technologies like chatbots, voice assistants, and self-driving cars rely heavily on deep learning models to make accurate predictions and decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the adoption of AI also raises critical ethical questions. Issues such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and job displacement remain topics of global debate. Researchers and policymakers are working together to establish guidelines for responsible AI use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another significant trend is the integration of AI with edge computing and IoT devices. This combination allows real-time processing in industries such as healthcare monitoring, manufacturing automation, and smart cities, where immediate insights are essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, AI is not just a technology but a paradigm shift. As it continues to evolve, the focus must balance innovation with accountability, ensuring that the benefits of AI are accessible and equitable across all societies.
